## Why are you making simple and TRASH websites? 
I made this webssite to polish my long forgotten JavaScript skills. 
Its my baby step to get into web development and explore more about JavaScript.

## Sucks at responsive design
I am really bad at front-end desigining i.e. CSS so please ignore it

## Who are they in the background video? 
Babymetal (stylized BABYMETAL) is a Japanese Kawaii Metal group that was initially formed in 2010 in Tokyo, Japan as a subunit of the female idol group Sakura Gakuin (さくら学院). 
Their concept is a fusion of Metal, j-pop, and idol.
